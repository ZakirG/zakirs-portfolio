        <div>
        <p><strong>OpusMelody</strong> is a digital audio workstation that allows the generation, editing, and export of MIDI compositions.</p>

        <p>We encode popular compositional approaches suggested by classical, jazz, pop, and hip hop lineages into procedural algorithms to create compositions matching user input, with some randomness sprinkled in.</p>

        <p>Built with Flask, Angular, and Python.</p>

        <h2>Generation Features and Compositional Algorithms</h2>

        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Generate a wide variety of high-quality chord progressions with fine control over the progression specs</li>
            <li>Use tasteful voicings and dynamic harmonic rhythms just by selecting one of our generation presets</li>
            <li>Orchestrate your progressions using a large list of monophonic and polyphonic presets</li>
            <li>Large library of hit progressions and chord voicings with configurable probabilities determining their inclusion</li>
            <li>Configure probabilities for the inclusion of non-diatonic, borrowed, altered dominant chords</li>
            <li>Logging panel in UI provides step-by-step explanations of the result generation method</li>
            <li>Export MIDI files of the entire project's composition as a zip file of MIDI tracks</li>
            <li>Import individual MIDI tracks</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Chord Generation + Selection Algorithms</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Library-based voicing selection</li>
            <li>Build chords from random scale tones</li>
            <li>Note nudge algorithm: nudge notes of previous chord to get next chord (like human piano hands)</li>
            <li>Chord leading based on chord leading chart</li>
            <li>Circular chord leading for smooth progression loops</li>
            <li>Can voice user-supplied numeral sequences</li>
            <li>Customizable topline contour shape</li>
            <li>Can restrict all voicings to be sus chords</li>
            <li>Specify the contour shape of a generated chord progression's topline (static, downward, up and then down...)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Orchestrate Your Progressions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Two-voice counterpoint with focused chord tone selection (ex: top line and lower middle line)</li>
            <li>Three-voice and four-voice counterpoint algorithms, still rough but good enough to be dangerous</li>
            <li>Standard arpeggios that can be set to quarter note, eighth note, customize number of repetitions per chord</li>
            <li>Randomized spiral-shaped arpeggios</li>
            <li>And more monophonic arpeggio shapes that can serve as orchestration support</li>
            <li>Winding lead generation (creating flowing melodic lines)</li>
            <li>Symmetric motif generation (creating melodies that are repeated on the first and second halves of the progression using matching chord tones)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>General App Features</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Add tracks and edit notes in a resizable piano roll window</li>
            <li>Export application state to a MIDI file and download the generation log that explains the music theory behind the composition</li>
            <li>Import user-provided MIDI files for automated manipulation</li>
            <li>Quickly generate compositions with the Quick Generate button that reruns the last-applied settings and clicks play</li>
            <li>Chords can be rolled bottom-up during playback with a configurable note roll offset, to help you better hear each tone created</li>
            <li>UI automatically calculates and labels chords with their names and scale degrees</li>
            <li>Cycle mode toggle button for looped playback</li>
        </ul>
